|[Deep Visual-Semantic Alignments for Generating Image Descriptions](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/cvpr2015.pdf)|Paper|IEEE|Use CNN to represent image feature, combine with RNN-based architecture to compute alignment score for image-sentence pair. Many future works are inspired from this paper wtih modification on models for encoder and decoder side, as well as modification on the way to align/attend image and sentences.|
