|[VecMap (cross-lingual word embedding mappings)](https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap)|Papers|Several Conferences|A series of paper by Mikel Artetxe that uses variation of VecMap to learn BLI: [Learning principled bilingual mappings of word embeddings while preserving monolingual invariance](https://aclanthology.org/D16-1250.pdf): investigate the effect of orthogonal mapping (transformation is orthogonally contrained), as well as length normalization and mean centering. [Learning bilingual word embeddings with (almost) no bilingual data](https://aclanthology.org/P17-1042.pdf): Use previous result iteratively and show superior results on small seed.[Generalizing and Improving Bilingual Word Embedding Mappings with a Multi-Step Framework of Linear Transformations](http://ixa.si.ehu.es/sites/default/files/dokumentuak/11455/aaai18.pdf): Learn orthogonal mapping in several steps to gain interpretability. Summarize previous works using 5 steps (whitening, re-weighting, etc.) [A robust self-learning method for fully unsupervised cross-lingual mappings of word embeddings](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1073.pdf) VecMap paper (zero seed ), use self-learning to improve dictionary and improve mappin. Added some tricks to make initialization and retrieval better, such as CSLS (basically the margin score for cosine similarity). |
|[Density Matching for Bilingual Word Embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02343.pdf)|Paper|NAACL2019| An approach that expresses the two monolingual embedding spaces as probability densities defined by a Gaussian mixture model, and matches the two densities using a method called normalizing flow. Additional training objective like weakly-supervision and orthogonal constraint are added.|
|[A Graph-based Coarse-to-fine Method for Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.318.pdf)|Paper|ACL2020|An approach that extracts word cliques from the graphs (with BK algorithm and pivoting) and map the cliques of two languages to get initial mapping (use clique embedding). Use this as seed dictionary to induce BLI (following SVD decomposition method before but use a groupof k W's instead of an universal one).|
