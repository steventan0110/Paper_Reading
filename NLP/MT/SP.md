|[A Study of Reinforcement Learning for Neural Machine Translation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1397.pdf)|Paper|ACL|Describe and summarize how RL can be used in NMT, including strategies for training RL (which is normally unstable) with reward shaping, and also experiment RL's benefits for monolingual data training.|
|[Reward Optimization for Neural Machine Translation with Learned Metrics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07541.pdf)|Paper|Arxiv|Summarize reward optimization techniques used in NMT and classify them as `Expected Reward Maximization` or `Ranking Optimization`. The paper explores contrastive-margin loss with new metric like BLEURT. BLEU is not increased but BLEURT is significantly increased, along with human evaluation score.
