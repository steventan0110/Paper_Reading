# NLP - Segmentation and Labeling
|[End-to-end Sequence Labeling via Bi-directional LSTM-CNNs-CRF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01354.pdf)|Paper|ACL|End-to-end labeling system trained on character-level. CNN layer is used to pool character level information, followed by Bi-LSTM to encode features, and on top of it, a CRF to label the sequence.
